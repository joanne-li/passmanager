# Something Awesome Project
## Password Manager

This project was completed for a university security course in Term 1 2020. It is a simple password manager which is meant to be run on local machine. The user's passwords are obscured in passfile.bin and keyfile in stored_cred.bin. The aim of this application is to reduce the cognitive load of remembering passwords. Password reuse reduces the strength of passwords.

### Demo it yourself


### Areas of improvement

- Generation of initialisation vector. IVs must not repeat. IVs can be generated by simply increasing a counter. Using the same IV for the same key would generate the same result. I did not enforce this rule, as IVs were randomly generated.
- Storage of passfile.bin and stored_cred.bin files. Control structures to prevent the user from accidently deleting this information should be added. Even informtion on the app, warning the user not to delete these files would be helpful.
